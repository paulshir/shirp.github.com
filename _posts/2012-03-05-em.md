So at the moment I'm just going to use this to place my notes on the design process.

I'm looking at the different css units used in scaling for web.
There are for units: px, pts, ems, %

Px and points aren't scalable units so they aren't necessarily recommended for web.
Although in theory the pt's could work.

em seems to be a generally good option. I have found one problem with it and that is
with margins. Em works off the current font size but when trying to line up different
headers of differnt sizes it proves dificult. To overcome this I recommend that I use
em's but to try wrap the elements in divs and scale them using that as this will be
tying back to the original font size.

Another thing to take note of that it is recommended that the original font size is
set to `font-size: 100%`. This is so that the em's scale properly.
