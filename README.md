#Personal Landing Page For Paul Shirley

This is a Jekyll powered blog. I am going to use it and attempt to create my own theme for it.



# About Jekyll-Bootstrap

Jekyll-Bootstrap is a simple way to get up and running using github pages to host a static website.

To change a theme use  rake theme:switch name="THEME-NAME"  This goes through every file in the includes folder for the new theme and will add it to the layout folder. Note the setup of the layout folder means that there can only be one default theme called default.html. You could change this in the layout folder but this wouldn't remain if you are to switch themes. The only option really would be to make changes to the RakeFile to add custom pages. Then again custom pages mightn't be needed. The best option would be if the layout could be defined in the settings file for the folder. That is work for another time though. By adding other pages and layouts it will make the blog incompatoble with other themes.
