#Personal Landing Page For Paul Shirley

This is a Jekyll powered blog. I am going to use it and attempt to create my own theme for it.



# About Jekyll-Bootstrap

Jekyll-Bootstrap is a simple way to get up and running using github pages to host a static website.

To change a theme use  rake theme:switch name="THEME_NAME"  This goes through every file in the layout folder. It basically just changes the theme options in
it. I don't think the current setup would work well for creating custom pages that didn't work of
a nested template. Anyway the code to understand what happens is in the Rakefile
